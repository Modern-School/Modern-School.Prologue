    <!-- Path to the preview image used on the steam workshop for your extension.
  This must be
    within your mod folder, be 16x9 aspect ratio and less than 1MB in size.
  I recommend the
    highest resolution you can provide that fits that criteria,
  though steam will likely use a
    version less than 512x512 in size, and will auto resize it for you.

  This can be different
    to the provided Logo.png if you want, as this will not be transparently backed on steam.
    Supported formats are .png, .jpg and .gif

    <!-- This is the workshop publish ID. The first time your extension is published to Steam, this
    will be automatically populated with the ID that steam assigns it.
  When this happens, make
    sure that you keep that version of the file and store the ID somewhere - without it, you wont be
    able to push out updates to your extension,
  and if it's removed, publishing to the workshop
    will submit it as a new entry, and you'll lose all of your subscribers. Be careful!
  Do not
    manually modify this unless you already know your Publish ID from a previous submission. A new
    ID will only be generated if this says "NONE"-->
